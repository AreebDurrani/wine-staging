Fixes: [21232] Chromium-based browser engines (Chrome, Opera, Comodo Dragon, SRWare Iron) crash on startup unless '--no-sandbox' is used (native API sandboxing/hooking scheme incompatible with Wine)
Fixes: [42741] StarCraft I: 1.18 PTR fails to initialize ClientSdk.dll
Fixes: [45349] Multiple applications and games crash due to missing support for 64-bit syscall thunks (StreetFighter V)
Fixes: [45573] League of Legends 8.12+ fails to start a game (anticheat engine, hooking of syscall return instructions)
Fixes: [45650] chromium 32-bit sandbox expects different syscall thunks depending on Windows version

# As of 43be3507c04, unless I've misread, ntdll.dll no longer has the chance to
# run code before ntdll.so performs process initialization. Unfortunately,
# ntdll.so is still making calls to Nt* exports during that process
# initialization, which in practice means it's calling syscall thunks. In order
# for this series to work, we need to poke __wine_syscall_dispatcher into the
# TEB before those calls are made. Fixing this would require a nontrivial amount
# of effort, which will be obviated as soon as Alexandre finishes splitting
# ntdll upstream.
